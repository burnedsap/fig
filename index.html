          The past couple of years have been a churn. Sometimes time races away
          like a silent bullet without you noticing and sometimes it drags like
          a weight tied to the feet of a prisoner. But then it is important to
          not move sometimes like you could hold it in your gaze.

          The loop captures my relationship with the time I spend on my art.
          Through this piece I acknowledge that I find myself in a void,
          struggling to keep up with the running seconds. My study table and
          shelf rest as a metaphor for my surroundings, reminding me to keep at
          it.

          Aside from the time I've lost by wasting it away, most of my
          experience with time is just me patiently waiting it to pass by and
          something to happen.

        <h3>Theme: Loss of Time</h3>
        <p>
          Time is a deeply personal experience and a highly unpredictable
          medium. As we strive to conquer time, there are moments when we find
          ourselves running behind it, and others when we are surprised at an
          unexpected route it has taken — stretching and compressing on its own
          whims and fancies. This year, FIG invites you to use the medium of a
          looping GIF to visualise your experiences with the cycle of losing
          time and regaining control.
